# ML_Projects ran in Sagemaker Notebook

This project demonstrates the use of Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model. It includes the process of data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment within the SageMaker environment.
Project Overview

    Objective: (Briefly describe the goal of the project, e.g., building a classification model for image recognition, predicting housing prices, etc.)
    Technologies Used:
        Amazon SageMaker
        Python (with libraries such as boto3, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch, etc.)
        Jupyter notebooks
        Amazon S3 (for data storage)
        AWS IAM roles (for permissions)

Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

    AWS Account: Access to an AWS account with SageMaker, S3, and IAM permissions configured.
    AWS CLI: Install and configure AWS CLI to interact with your AWS account.
    Python: Version 3.7 or above.
    Amazon SageMaker Studio (optional but recommended) for an interactive environment.
    Jupyter Notebooks: For running the code and visualizing the process.

AWS Resources Required:

    SageMaker Notebook Instance: For writing and running your code.
    S3 Bucket: For storing datasets and model artifacts.
    IAM Role: With permissions for SageMaker, S3, and other necessary AWS services.
